DG4R.CG4R - Association - 45 common driver regions. The genomic coordinate information of 45 common breast cancer driver regions were 
taken from Curtis et al. Nature 2012 and adapted to the hg19 coordinate information using the liftover tool from UCSC. DG4Rs or CG4Rs were 
associated with the 45 common driver regions using intervene pairwise and the bedtools fisher option.

Check association of breast cancer driver genes with qG4-ChIP-seq data

#1) Curtis et al. breast cancer driver list converted to hg19 using UCSC liftover tool.
Use intervene to overlap with G4s in different CNA states or Promoter G4s in different CNA and gene expression states.
Use pre-existing coordinate information for the G4-data sets.

#2) Measure association using fisher test.
