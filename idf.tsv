Investigation Title	G-quadruplex (G4) DNA structural landscape of breast cancers reports on their genomic and transcriptomic architecture							
Experiment Description	"Aberrant gene regulation and chromatin interactions are key processes in cancer development. We developed a quantitative high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing methodology to map differentially enriched G-quadruplex DNA regions (DG4Rs) in breast cancer patient-derived tumour xenograft (PDTX) models. We show that DG4Rs are more prevalent in aggressive triple-negative than estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, particularly at amplification loci. We uncover two distinct transcription factor programs associated with triple-negative or estrogen receptor-positive tumours in a mutually exclusive way. We demonstrate here that quantitatively assessed G4 DNA content in amplified loci positively correlates with sensitivity to G4-ligands. In summary, quantitatively measured G4 DNA content is informative for cancer stratification and treatment.  11 PDTX models were investigated by qG4-ChIP-seq. In total 16 PDTX specimen were analysed. For each specimen (16 PDTX chromatin samples) 4 technically identical ChIP-seq experiments + 1 matched Input experiment was performed and subjected to Nextera DNA library preparation. All 80 libraries were sequenced by the Nextseq500 technology using single-end sequencing and 75 high output flowcells. In total 14 flowcells were sequenced for this study. The name of each file follows the following nomenclature: \""PDTX.model(ID)_biological.replicate(ID)_technical.replicate.or.input(R1...R4 or input)_flowcell.ID(H...) _sequencing.lane(L001-004).fastq.gz\"""

Protocol Description	"PDTX specimen were created by Bruna et al. Cell 2016. Reference, spike-in chromatin were produced from S2 D.melanogaster cells. Briefly, D. melanogaster S2 cells were cultured in Schneider's Drosophila Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. R69007) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) Medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. 10500064). To prepare spike-in chromatin, 100 million cells were i) harvested by centrifugation, ii) fixed for 10 min in a solution of media containing 10 % FBS, 1% Formaldehyde (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. 28908) and iii) quenched for 5 min by addition of 125 mM glycine (Fisher Scientific, cat no. 11545005). The harvested, fixed and quenched cell pellet was washed with 10 mL PBS, pelleted by centrifugation and subsequently stored on ice for the lysis procedure. "	"PDTX chromatin preparation: Briefly, a snap-frozen PDTX biopsy, ~1 cm3, was transferred into a 50 mL falcon tube, on dry-ice, and crushed into smaller chunks on dry-ice using a scalpel. The crushed tissue was subsequently fixed for 20 min in 30 ml solution A, containing 1 % formaldehyde, and inactivated for 5 min by adding 125 mM glycine. The supernatant of the pelleted tissue was discarded, and the tissue pellet washed twice with 10 mL ice-cold PBS. The remaining pellet is resuspended in 1 mL PBS and transferred to a 1 mL glass douncer (Fisher scientific, cat no. 11591295). 10 strokes were employed for each douncing step, loose and tight pestle, and the remaining tissue slurry was transferred to a 15 mL tube, centrifuged for 5 min at 2500xg and subjected to the lysis protocol of Schmidt et al19. Briefly, after the 10 mL LB2 treatment and nuclei pelleting step, the pellet was resuspended in 500 µL LB3 and LB3-chromatin solution split into two Bioruptor TBX (Diagenode, cat no. C30010010-300) sonication tubes. The samples were sonicated until the desired fragment length (100-500 bp) was achieved. Finally, 50 µL of a 10% Triton X-100 LB3 solution was mixed with the sonicated solution before 50 µL aliquotation by snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.  Reference or spike-in chromatin preparation: The 2-step chromatin lysis procedure was performed according to the Chromatrap procedure (\""Spin column ChIP kit for qPCR v6.4\""). 500 uL intact chromatin was sonicated into 100-500 bp fragments using the Bioruptor Plus technology in combination with continues cooling (Diagenode cat. no. B02010003) at 4C. Sonicated chromatin was diluted with 1.5 mL lysis buffer (Chromatrap cat no. 100005) before snap-freezing as 25 µL aliquots. PDTX chromatin was prepared essentially as described in Schmidt et al. (Methods 2009).   ChIP:  We subjected in total 75 ng of PDTX chromatin and 34 ng of spike-in chromatin into each G4-ChIP-seq reaction. All PDTX chromatin batches containing a different concentration than 30 ng/µL were balanced to the same level, either by dilution with LB3 containing 10 % Triton X-100 or by up-scaling the ChIP reaction until a 75 ng PDTX and 34 ng spike-in was achieved. For PDTX chromatin with a concentration of 30 ng/µL we added 2.5 µL to a solution containing 88 µL binding buffer, 2 uL RNase A, 2.5 µL spike-in chromatin. Subsequent incubations were performed as recently described and 150 ng of BG4 was added to a qG4-ChIP-seq reaction. Washing, elution and library preparation was performed as recently described.  "	Purified DNAs were subjected to Nextera DNA library preparation.	Libraries were sequenced via the Nextseq500 technology using 75bp single-end sequencing.	"Spike-in normalisation strategy. qG4-ChIP-seq uses low-input amounts (75 ng chromatin; quantification performed by the Qubit technology using the \""broad range kit\"" (Thermo Fisher Scientific, cat no. Q32853), 5 µL chromatin in 200 µL Qubit buffer, corresponding to ~15,000 tumour cells. Hence, a single PDTX biopsy produces sufficient chromatin to conduct at least 4 technically identical ChIP experiments and 1 input (control) experiment. Our strategy assumes that after normalising 4 repeated experiments, containing the same PDTX and spike-in chromatin, qG4-ChIP-seq datasets become more similar and/or more dissimilar to different PDTX qG4-ChIP-seq datasets (Fig. 2a, b and Extended Data Fig. 1). Importantly, we performed all 64 qG4-ChIP-seq experiments with the same amount of spike-in chromatin and batch, suggesting that alterations in spike-in qG4-ChIP-seq coverage are linked to experimental and not biological variability. To estimate PDTX normalisation factors, we aligned20 all the G4-ChIP-seq read information to a combined genome, consisting of hg19 (H. Sapiens), dm6 (D. melanogaster) and mm10 (M. musculus). Besides analysing the total dm6 read recovery21 for all 64 qG4-ChIP-seq experiments, we employed MACS peak calling to identify G4-antibody enriched regions. We assessed total dm6, as well as dm6 G4-region specific read coverages and derived normalisation factors for 63 out of 64 qG4-ChIP-seq experiments that, respectively, would equalise all 63 dm6 read coverages to the same depth as the one qG4-ChIP-seq experiment showing the highest dm6 read coverage. Critically, these normalisation factors are then employed to normalise the hg19 G4-ChIP-seq read coverages, respectively. However, it remains unclear if normalisation necessarily leads to an increased data reproducibility or unwanted artefacts by means of normalisation, consequently leading to false data and conclusions. To overcome this issue, we report here a novel concept of assessing normalisation performance by measuring data similarity and dissimilarity before and after normalisation. We mathematically express data similarity by euclidean distance and measure all the possible distance combination for all 64 hg19 qG4-ChIP-seq datasets. The mathematical expression to measure normalisation performance is available in the associated manuscript.  "	n.a.	n.a.	"Mapping, peak calling and peak processing. Raw FASTQ reads were trimmed to remove adaptor contamination and aligned to a combined genome containing Homo sapiens (hg19), Drosophila (dm6) and Mus musculus (mm10) using cutadapt22 and bwa20, respectively. Reads with a mapping quality below ten or marked as positional duplicates were excluded from further analysis. Enriched G4-ChIP-seq peaks were mapped using MACS2.023. The bedtools package (http://bedtools.readthedocs.org) multiinter was employed to process MACS2.0-called peak intervals (enriched G4 regions) and to generate high-confidence (2 out of 4) peak overlaps between technical G4-ChIP-seq replicates; partial peak overlaps below 100 bp were removed from high-confidence peak overlaps."
